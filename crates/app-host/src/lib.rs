//! One window, one module, no window manager.
//!
//! An `AppModule` never opens a window: it is created inside a splash
//! isolate by a host, which hands it the four things the contract names —
//! a scope, a storage namespace, a viewport and a reply channel — and then
//! draws the root it returns. The OctoSense shell does that in a tile,
//! with a launcher, a bus and a shade around it. This crate does the same
//! thing with nothing around it, so the identical app crate can ship three
//! ways: a desktop binary, a mobile binary, or a module linked into the
//! shell for the ROM.
//!
//! An app's standalone entry is then a window with [`AppHostView`] in it
//! plus one call to [`AppHostViewRef::open`]; see `apps/*/native/src/bin`.
//!
//! What this host deliberately does NOT provide, because there is no shell
//! around it: the assistant bus (the module's `ServiceExecutor` is held but
//! never called), tiles and focus arbitration, and the launcher catalog. A
//! module that only reaches those through the bus still runs; it simply has
//! no assistant in the window.
