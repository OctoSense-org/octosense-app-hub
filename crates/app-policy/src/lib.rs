//! ADR 0002 phase 1: one declaration, two containers.
//!
//! An app that arrives after the build ships a bundle and a manifest. This
//! crate is the only thing that turns that manifest into what the app gets:
//! the settings for its splash isolate, and the profile for its octos agent
//! session. Both come from the same resolved [`AppPolicy`], so the app and
//! its agent can never have different reach.
//!
//! The order is always: [`AppManifest::parse`] → [`verify::admit`] →
//! [`policy::resolve`] → [`AppPolicy::isolate_settings`] and
//! [`AppPolicy::session_profile`]. Skipping a step is the bug this crate
//! exists to make hard.
//!
//! ```
//! use octosense_app_policy::{admit_and_resolve, HostLimits, RefuseAllSignatures};
//! let bundle = b"the card bundle bytes";
//! let manifest = format!(
//!     r#"{{"schema":1,"id":"weather","version":"1.0.0","name":"Weather",
//!         "integrity":{{"bundle_blake3":"{}"}},
//!         "capabilities":["storage","net"],
//!         "network":{{"hosts":["api.weather.example"]}}}}"#,
//!     octosense_app_policy::bundle_digest(bundle)
//! );
//! let limits = HostLimits { require_signature: false, ..HostLimits::default() };
//! let policy = admit_and_resolve(&manifest, bundle, &limits, &RefuseAllSignatures).unwrap();
//! assert!(policy.allows_host("api.weather.example"));
//! assert!(!policy.allows_host("example.com"));
//! assert!(policy.agent.is_none(), "an app gets no agent unless it asks");
